# Gwyn-The-Human
My first project! Completed for the free online harvard course CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python (https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/); using this to practice pushing an dpulling and using Github in general! More to come! 

Much of the code included is provided already by the course; I had to write a bredth-first search that will count the degrees of seperation between two actors in the IMDB database.
